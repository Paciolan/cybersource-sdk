Note Before you request the authorization, you must inform the issuer of the customer contract numbers that will be used for recurring transactions.  #### Worldpay VAP For a follow-on credit with Worldpay VAP, CyberSource checks the following locations, in the order given, for a customer account ID value and uses the first value it finds: 1. `customer_account_id` value in the follow-on credit request 2. Customer account ID value that was used for the capture that is being credited 3. Customer account ID value that was used for the original authorization If a customer account ID value cannot be found in any of these locations, then no value is used.  For processor-specific information, see the `customer_account_id` field description in [Credit Card Services Using the SCMP API.](http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SCMP_API/html)
